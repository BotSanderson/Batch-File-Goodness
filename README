This file was made in spirit of me and my friend's boredom in the computer lab in school. It is also my first program in batch that is longer than 3 lines. 

-1.1-
In the new version, I changed the problem where the program closed when you entered anything in the field that was not exatly the same as the variables I defined. It no longer does that. It simply tells you incorrect password, or Invalid Program this time.
